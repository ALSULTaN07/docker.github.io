## Orientation

While we'll define concepts along the way, it is good for you to
understand [what Docker is](#WHATDOCKER) and [why you would use
Docker](#WHYDOCKER) before we begin.

In this tutorial, you will:

1. Get set up and oriented, on this page.
2. [Create a "Hello World" application that identifies its environment](part2.md)
3. [Hook up a visitor counter](part3.md)
4. [Configure persistent data for our application](part4.md)
5. [Set up a scalable cluster in production](part5.md)
6. [Configure load-balancing and SSL](part6.md)
7. [Learn next steps](part7.md)

The application itself is very simple so that you are not too distracted by
what the code is doing. After all, the value of Docker is in how it can build,
ship, and run applications; it's totally agnostic as to what your application
actually does.

## Setup

Before we get started, make sure your system has the latest version of Docker
installed.

[Install Docker](/engine/installation/index.md){: class="button darkblue-btn"}

## Let's go!

If you understand that container images package application code and their
dependencies all together in a portable deliverable, and your environment has
Docker installed, let's move on!
